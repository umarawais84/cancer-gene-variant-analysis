# cancer-gene-variant-analysis
This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing variant frequencies in cancer-associated genes. Using stacked bar plots, the project highlights the distribution of genetic variants across different genes in tumor samples. Developed as part of a summer internship focused on cancer genomics and data visualization.
